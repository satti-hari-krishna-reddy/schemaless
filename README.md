# Schemaless
A general purpose JSON standardization translation engine, using language models to translate for you

## Goal
Make it easy to standardize the output of given data, no matter what the input was. After the translation has been done with an LLM the first time, the keys are sorted and hashed, and the structure is saved, meaning if it was correct, you will ever only have run the same data structure thorugh the setup ONCE. 

If you want **NEW** automatic translations, it requires an API-key for any LLM provider. This is not required for old translations:
```
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key
export OPENAI_API_URL=https://your-provider
```

## Use the package
```
go get github.com/frikky/schemaless
```

```
// Translate random string -> JSON paths
output := schemaless.Translate(ctx context.Context, standard string, userinput string)

// Translate outputted data -> standard location
output, err := ReverseTranslate(sourceMap, searchInMap) 
```

## Test it
We built in a test that you can use. Go to the backend folder, and run it:
```
cd backend
go run webservice.go
```

Then in another terminal:
```
sh test.sh
```

## Example:
This is an example that finds matching nested values based on the User Input and puts it in the value of the standard field. The output values should be in a nested jq/shuffle json format.

**Standard**:
```
{
	"kms_key": "The KMS name",
	"kms_value": "The value found for the KMS name"
}
```

**User Input**:
```
{
	"secret": {
		"name":"username",
		"version":{
			"version":"1",
			"type":"kv",
			"value":"frikky"
		}
	}
}
```

**Expected output**: 
```
{
	"kms_key": "secret.name",
	"kms_value": "secret.version.value"
}
```


## Reverse Example
There are however cases where you have done translation from input data to output data, but don't have a reference of how the translation between them happened. In this case, we built a reverse translation search which also outputs the path in the same way. This e.g. allows us to NOT keep using AI translation after it's been done once, and instead override the translation itself with just a JSON reference.

**Outputted data:**
```
{
	"findme": "This is the value to find",
	"subkey": {
		"findAnother": "This is another value to find",
		"subsubkey": {
			"findAnother2": "Amazing subsubkey to find"
		},
		"sublist": [
			"This is a list",
			"This is a list",
			"Cool list item",
			"This is a list"
		],
		"objectlist": [{
			"key1": "This is a key"
		},
		{
			"key1": "Another cool thing"
		}]
	}
}`
```

**The standard with the data locations to find:**
```
{
	"key1": "This is the value to find",
	"key2": "This is another value to find",
	"key3": "Amazing subsubkey to find",
	"key4": "Cool list item",
	"key5": "Another cool thing"
}
```


**Expected Output**:
```
{
	"key1": "findme",
	"key2": "subkey.findAnother",
	"key3": "subkey.subsubkey.findAnother2",
	"key5": "subkey.objectlist.#1.key1",
	"key4": "subkey.sublist.#2"
}
```
